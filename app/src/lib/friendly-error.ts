/**
 * Turns a raw wallet/backend/program error into one plain sentence a user can act on: what happened,
 * whether their money is safe, and what to do next. From the multichain site's friendly-error.ts,
 * rewritten for the Solana pool:
 *   - program errors: `PROGRAM_ERROR:<name>` from lib/program.ts, names from the IDL (PROGRAM_ERRORS);
 *   - backend reason codes: backend/colosseum_app.py (ACTION_HINTS);
 *   - wallet errors: rejections, missing SOL (PATTERNS);
 *   - the app's own messages, already plain English (OWN_MESSAGES).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: an unmatched error still falls through to a plain-English generic message at the
 * bottom, never to the raw string. A missing entry here is a worse message, not a leaked code.
